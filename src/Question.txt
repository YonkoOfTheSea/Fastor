Restaurant Review System
Build a web application to search restaurants in Bengaluru using Zomato api and add review. This web app
should have sign up for new users and login for existing users. When a user logs-in, the home page should have restaurant search option. 
This search option should have ability to search by cuisines, restaurant type and restaurant category.

The search result should display atleast following details per restaurant:

Restaurant name - DOne
url to zomato page - DOne
Cuisines type - DOne
User_rating info - DOne
Price info - DONE
if possible add thumbnail as well - DONE

When the user clicks on a restaurant, new page should open with all possible restaurant information. The user
should have ability to add review for the restaurant and this should be saved in a hosted database (These reviews
are different from the reviews that are present on Zomato). Whenever someone opens a restaurant page, the
reviews also should be shown on the restaurant info page.
Review should contain a rating from 1-5 and description.

The application should have following pages
Login/Signup Page
Search Page
Restaurant page along with existing reviews pulled from hosted database. And also a section to add a review.
We'll prefer if this can be hosted on any free hosting server instead of localhost.
